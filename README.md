<h1>RockFace!</h1>

<h2>Origination</h2>
this application is code just for fun . <br/>
a small story:<br/>
	father code an application which can switch facemask when wave the phone, and his daughter play it very happy.<br/> 

<h2>Procgress</h2>
the fist menu in the application was like the story above. but now, it didnot work very well .<br/>
it use accelarator to judge if the phone was waved . but it is not very sensitive.<br/>
so i think whether change a type of sensor to judge ,like speed.<br/>
the second menu is a test for ImageSwitcher ,code from google :)<br/>
